# NewCYdatabase
Includes CY 3-fold constructed as hypersurface featured Z2 symmetry with 1&lt;h11&lt;8 and 7&lt;h11&lt;13.

Datas could be divided to four part from two points: NID for h11 less than 8, reflection for h11 less than 8, NID for h11 greater than 7, reflection for h11 greater than 7.
# First is the h11.
We compute the CY threefold for all FRST of all favorable polytope for 1<h11<8;
And that for part of FRST of some favorable polytope for 7<h11<13.

# Second is the $Z_2$ symmetry
There are two types of $Z_2$ symmetry, one introduced by NID involution and one by divisor reflection.
We considered all the proper NID case for every ambient space in our work, and all 1-divisor, 2-divisors and 3-divisors reflection for 1<h11<7; All 1-divisor , 15 2-divisors and 15 3-divisors for h11=7; 30 3-divisors for 7<h11<13.
